## Invest your time in making your life much more antifragile. 

Find better ways to control your emotions and diligently replace old habits with new best practices.

When you are unable to take advantage of increasing levels of chaos, competition, innovation happening in the world, it your fault for being stuck in your old ways ... stop EVER blaming others. Just stop it!

***The problem and, more importantly, the solution is in YOU ... YOU can fix the problem, but not unless you ditch your ego.***

The solution is continuously compounded improvement in discipline and being enough of a minimalist to never be held back by something that you have wasted money on in the past. You cannot live in the future, but you can fall in love with and live in NOW.

## Don't Believe Me. Just Watch.
