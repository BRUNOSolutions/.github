# BE An Example

## BE a Christian

Stop telling people that you are a Christian; stop thinking of heaven as a post-death retirement community where you get to hang out with your favorite people. 

If you want to BE a Christian, then BE one.

Your ONLY comfort in life and in death is that you are not your own any more.  You are SAVED by Jesus Christ and that means completely transcending your former existence. Being saved means that you become obsessed with a desire to be fully possessed and owned by Christ; this includes every thing that you can think of -- your body, your mind, and your soul; in this life and in whatever might come thereafter.

## Endeavor to compound the improvement of antifragility 

*With every second ... exemplify gratitude as you improve the yield potential your* ***luck surface***

Develop discipline for the emotional fitness to constantly replace old habits that are holding you back with new better practices. **Stop EVER blaming others!**

***The problem and, more importantly, the solution is in YOU ... YOU can fix the problem with your fragility, but not until you ditch your ego.*** 

Stop clinging to the past, to illusions in the rear view mirror -- right now is awesome and your future is going to be better *because you are going to work at making it that way.* 


## Be UNIQUE

**NEVER EVER EVER try to just fit in; NEVER EVER EVER tolerate gossip, hate-mongering or any form of community-supported fear.**

Imitate ONLY greatness; study what makes people great, but be your own person ... be aware of it, but avoid consuming any dipshit mindfuckery; call out stupidity when you see it.

*Don't Believe Me. Just Watch.*
