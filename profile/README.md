SERVE your core constituencies FIRST! Enlist these people in becoming their own solution, dogfooding their own toolset.

# Bruno SOLUTIONS are primarily about what Bruno SHOULD do

***For Example ... Bruno Should BE A Better Example Of Working At The Discipline of Being A Better Example***

As an example of what I should be a better example of, I strongly ***believe*** in [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) the heck out of everything I do ... Bruno.Solutions is about refactoring and upcycling of eating my own dogfood in order have the energy to make dogfood that that I can eat ... this is what *SERVE your constituents FIRST* political philosophy is about.

# SERVE your core constituencies FIRST! is an example of active campaign.

The whole point of the ***SERVE your constituents FIRST!*** is to run a campaign as a better example how campaigns should be done.

***SERVE your core constituencies FIRST!*** is a radically different political philosophy. It's neither right nor left, it is a forward-looking mindset of builders rather than a backward-looking mindset of whiners longing for a past that never was that they think they see in the rear view mirror. 

***SERVE your core constituencies FIRST!*** means that the campaign solutions or services are all about [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) ... that expression is about actually listening to your own advice and criticisms as you develop and extend the tools you use to develop the tools that churn out your development campaign. 

***SERVE your core constituencies FIRST!*** is about letting the dead bury the dead. and moving forward. True freedom and true independence from politicians, especially from politicians who pander to the gossips, victims, those who give up and complain rather than get down to business and fight.

***SERVE your core constituencies FIRST!*** is about choosing the independence and freedom that comes from the discipline of leveling up everyone's skills to build and develop their own tools. 

***SERVE your core constituencies FIRST!*** is about REALLY ***serving*** your constituents by challenging them to build and develop their own solutions rather than pandering for the votes of losers who are encouraged to stay dependent and think like victims. The radically different anti-pandering, NO EXCUSES political philosophy is about a campaign of campaigners that embody and build the ***SERVE your constituents FIRST!*** movement. 

***SERVE your core constituencies FIRST!*** campaign involves ONLY those friends, peers, allies who have chosen to SERVE rather than give in to victim others, but rather have chosen to be developers and builders, chosen to be sustainably INDEPENDENT. We're not in this campaign of building the discipline to build and develop alone ... but the INDEPENDENT thinkers out there understand that it does not matter if one seems to be alone or seems to be in an overwhelming majority.
