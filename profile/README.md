## Endeavor to compound the improvement of antifragility 

*With every second ... exemplify gratitude as you improve the yield potential your* ***luck surface***

Develop discipline for the emotional fitness to constantly replace old habits that are holding you back with new better practices. **Stop EVER blaming others!**

***The problem and, more importantly, the solution is in YOU ... YOU can fix the problem with your fragility, but not until you ditch your ego.*** 

Stop clinging to the past, to illusions in the rear view mirror -- right now is awesome and your future is going to be better *because you are going to work at making it that way.* 


## Don't Believe Me. Just Watch.
