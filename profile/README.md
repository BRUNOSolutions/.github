# BE An Example

## BE a Christian

Stop telling people that you are a Christian ... the *tell* is you need to preach to others, rather than to *personally* BE a Christian.

Stop being a wishy-washy candy-ass ... people are disgusted by the faux, half-ass, goody two shoes, sunday school kiddie song, form of PRETEND *christianity.*

Stop thinking of heaven as a post-death retirement community where you get to hang out with your favorite people. 

If you want to BE a Christian, then **you** have BE a better Christian than you are right now.

YOU need to work harder at changing *you* ... YOU have to up your discipline game. EVERY. SINGLE. MOMENT. OF. EVERY. DAY.

**Your ONLY comfort in life and in death must be that you are not your own any more.** 

**Your ONLY comfort in life and in death must be that you are not your own any more.** 

**Your ONLY comfort in life and in death must be that you are not your own any more.**

## YOU must change; YOU must be commited to the discipline of continuing to change.

You are SAVED by Jesus Christ. That requires you to work harder at completely transcending your former existence. 

Being saved means that you become obsessed with a desire to be fully possessed and owned by Christ.

Your discipline is about your soul; if you care about your soul, you commitment to the discipline of being a better Christian must include every thing that you can think of -- your body, your mind, and your soul; in this life and in whatever might come thereafter.

## When you pray or meditate, do it RIGHT

*Or don't do it at all ... do NOT fuck around with prayer; nothing is more serious.*

FOCUS on exactly three asks ... and focus on those in the following priority, ie it's most important to just ask for the first thing and trust God on the others.

***1) Ask that the WILL of the Creator of the Universe be done and that you will joyfully celebrate the manifestation of that WILL.***

**2) Ask that you will have what you need for the next day or few hours***; remember the first and most important ask in your prayer, ie realize that *you will not have the best of everything; you will make the best of everything.*

***3) Ask that you will be able to forgive the transgression of others and you not ever be tempted to cease fearing, loving and respecting your Creator.*** As part of this, you might ask that you will be guided in ways that might practically help eliminate the suffering of others.

As a general rule, do not ask for OR expect more than this. 

Your Creator sees your concerns ... ***focus on the three asks, according to the right priority*** ... do not whine or beg, ***PRAY in order to BE WITH Your Creator.***
  
## Endeavor to compound the improvement of antifragility 

*With every second ... exemplify gratitude as you improve the yield potential your* ***luck surface***

Develop discipline for the emotional fitness to constantly replace old habits that are holding you back with new better practices. **Stop EVER blaming others!**

***The problem and, more importantly, the solution is in YOU ... YOU can fix the problem with your fragility, but not until you ditch your ego.*** 

Stop clinging to the past, to illusions in the rear view mirror -- right now is awesome and your future is going to be better *because you are going to work at making it that way.* 


## Be UNIQUE

**NEVER EVER EVER try to just fit in; NEVER EVER EVER tolerate gossip, hate-mongering or any form of community-supported fear.**

Imitate ONLY greatness; study what makes people great, but be your own person ... be aware of it, but avoid consuming any dipshit mindfuckery; call out stupidity when you see it.

*Don't Believe Me. Just Watch.*
