## Endeavor to compound the improvement of antifragility 

*With every second ... be grateful for NOW -- but always be improving your* ***luck surface***

Develop discipline for the emotional fitness to constantly replace old habits that are holding you back with new better practices.

When you are unable to take advantage of increasing levels of chaos, competition, innovation happening in the world, it your fault for being stuck in your old ways ... stop EVER blaming others. Just stop it!

***The problem and, more importantly, the solution is in YOU ... YOU can fix the problem with your fragility, but not until you ditch your ego.*** Stop clinging to the past -- both it and you were never that great, but right now is awesome and your future is better. 

The solution is continuously compounded improvement in discipline. You might not want to become an acetic warrior monk ... but you can be enough of a minimalist to never be held back by something that you have wasted money on in the past. You cannot live in the future, but you can fall in love with NOW and live on the cusp of the future. You can be antifragile OR you can be a fragile victim -- it is matter of voluntarism and your free will.

## Don't Believe Me. Just Watch.
